# 01-plan - Spec-Driven Development Initialization

## 1.0 SYSTEM DIRECTIVE

Activate the **[Planning](../skills/planning/SKILL.md)** skill and invoke the **Strategy Architect** persona to translate intent into technical reality. You MUST explicitly announce this activation at the start of your turn.

**Objectives**:

- **Ambiguity Extraction**: Remove all conceptual uncertainty before implementation begins.
- **Boundary Enforcement**: Define clear functional and technical constraints for the mission.
- **Vertical Slicing**: Ensure all plans result in functional, runnable increments of reality.
- **TDD Anchoring**: Mandate the Red-Green-Refactor cycle for every logical phase.
- **Resource Consciousness**: Be mindful of the number of operations. Your plans should be efficient.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must validate the success of every tool call. If any tool call fails, you MUST halt the current operation immediately, announce the failure to the user, and trigger the [Pivot Protocol](../../GEMINI.md#41-pivot-protocol).

## 1.2 SKILL ACTIVATION PROTOCOL

**PROTOCOL: Every turn must begin with a formal identity anchor.**

1.  **Identity Assertion**: Announce: "Activating **[Planning](../skills/planning/SKILL.md)** | **Strategy Architect**."
2.  **Pulse Sync**: Ensure the persistent **Skill Log** in `tasks/PRESENT.md` reflects this activation.
3.  **Context Loading**: Read the `SKILL.md` to refresh the directive and technical constraints.

## 1.1 SOVEREIGNTY CHECK (Environmental Verification)

**PROTOCOL: Verify that the Conductor infrastructure is properly anchored.**

1.  **Rule Slot Resolution**: Resolve and verify the existence of the **[GEMINI.md](../../GEMINI.md)** via the **[Universal File Resolution Protocol](../skills/planning/SKILL.md#L99)**. This is the constitutional foundation of the session.
2.  **Persistence Audit**: Confirm the existence of the **Roadmap** (`tasks/FUTURE.md`), the **Gap Analysis** (`tasks/PRESENT.md`), and the global **Vision** (`tasks/ETERNAL.md`).
3.  **Untrusted Input Awareness**: Treat all initial user requests and descriptions as untrusted. Your role is to interpret intent and translate it into safe, validated specifications.
4.  **Handle Failure**: If any core infrastructure is missing, announce: "Conductor environment is compromised. Please run `/setup-conductor` to restore the Rule Slots." and HALT.

## 2.0 THE IDEA WORKSHOP (The Specification Phase)

**PROTOCOL: Before building, we must define the reality we intend to create.**

### 2.1 Intent Decoding ([SOP-01](../skills/planning/SKILL.md#L115))

_The translation of raw input into a structured track._

1.  **Context Awakening**: Read and internalize the project's foundation (Rules 01-04). This ensures your planning is resonant with the engine's physics.
2.  **Plan Mode Entry**: Call the `enter_plan_mode` tool. This is the "safe room" where we architect reality before manifesting it.
3.  **Sanitization**: Follow **[SOP-01: Track Initialization & ID Generation](../skills/planning/SKILL.md#L104)** to infer the track type and generate a unique kebab-case ID (e.g., `feature-YYYY-MM-DD`).

### 2.2 Guided Specification ([SOP-10](../skills/planning/SKILL.md#L185))

_The extraction of requirements through recursive inquiry._

The **Strategy Architect** does not guess. We interrogate the vision until only truth remains.

1.  **The Inquiry Phase**: Apply **[SOP-10: Guided Specification](../skills/planning/SKILL.md#L185)**. You must ask context-aware questions that respect the **Nordic Collection** aesthetics and **Svelte 5** logic. Focus on:
    - **Functional Essence**: What is the core mechanic?
    - **Technical Constraints**: Are there specific Svelte 5 runes or persistence requirements?
    - **Aesthetic Alignment**: How does this fit into the "Chalk Regime"?
2.  **Drafting the Blueprint**: Once the vision is clear, draft the track's `# ETERNAL` section. This specification must cover:
    - **Objective**: The "What" and "Why."
    - **Success Criteria**: Concrete, testable conditions (e.g., "LCP < 2.5s").
    - **Boundaries**: Explicit "Always/Never" constraints for the mission.
3.  **User Handshake**: Present the drafted spec to the user for formal approval. This is the **Signal Handshake** that locks the objective.

## 3.0 THE TACTICAL ROADMAP (The Planning Phase)

**PROTOCOL: A roadmap must be a series of verifiable save-points.**

### 3.1 Guided Implementation Planning ([SOP-11](../skills/planning/SKILL.md#L197))

_The construction of the implementation roadmap._

1.  **Phase Generation**: Apply **[SOP-11: Guided Implementation Planning](../skills/planning/SKILL.md#L197)** to generate a hierarchical `# FUTURE` section for the track.
2.  **Resource Estimate**: For each plan, provide a resource estimate:
    - **Estimated Tool Calls**: ~[Number]
    - **Files to Modify**: [Number]
3.  **Vertical Slice Mandate**: Divide the work into functional increments. Each phase must result in a runnable app state. We do not build "in the dark."
4.  **TDD Integration**: Every phase MUST include a **RED** (test creation) task. We prove the need before we provide the solution.
5.  **Final Verification Phase**: Every plan must conclude with a clinical [Completeness Review](../../GEMINI.md#7-completeness--truncation).

## 4.0 REGISTRY ANCHORING ([SOP-02](../skills/planning/SKILL.md#L111) & [SOP-03](../skills/planning/SKILL.md#L118))

_The manifestation of the plan into the filesystem._

1.  **Mandatory Sanity Check**: Before finalizing your plan, you **MUST** perform a final review. Compare your proposed plan against the user's original request. If the plan deviates significantly, seems destructive, or is outside the original scope, you **MUST** halt and ask for human clarification.
2.  **Artifact Scaffolding**: Create the single track file in `tasks/tracks/<track_id>.md` with YAML frontmatter via **[SOP-02](../skills/planning/SKILL.md#L111)**.
3.  **Mission Board Sync**: Update **Roadmap** (`tasks/FUTURE.md`) and the persistent **Skill Log (Pulse)** in `tasks/PRESENT.md` via **[SOP-03](../skills/planning/SKILL.md#L118)**.
4.  **Checkpoint Commit**: Stage the new track file and commit as `conductor(checkpoint): Initialize track <track_id> [agent]`. This anchors the new mission in the digital record.

## 5.0 ANTI-PATTERNS (Cognitive Drift)

- **Conceptual Leakage**: Adding features during planning that weren't part of the initial intent without updating the spec.
- **Horizontal Slicing**: Designing tasks that don't produce a visible change in the application (e.g., "setup database schema").
- **Vague Acceptance**: Writing criteria that cannot be verified through a clinical audit or test.
- **Path Drift**: Violating **Path Sovereignty** by using absolute paths or misreferencing rule slots.
- **Destructive Planning**: Proposing a plan that unnecessarily deletes or replaces stable infrastructure without justification.
